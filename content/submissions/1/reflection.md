From this brief activity, I learned the basic definition of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I also found out how they are applied in the industry, from business organizations to other fields. For the activity overall, I found it difficult to design my portfolio from scratch, but I had help from my peers and managed to output an acceptable web page that I can utilize for the rest of the semester. This activity helped me understand that Information Technology, as a field of study, is vast and each aspect, from software development, systems administration, and data analysis, are all interconnected with one another to create a web of innovative technologies. An advancement in one side of it can help improve the processes involved in another aspect of it. This highlights the importance of learning about these topics to ensure that we can make use of IT to its fullest capabilities.
